# Shoes Classification with Convolutional Neural Network

## Introduction

Shoes Classification with Convolutional Neural Network is my solution to make the algorithm that can detect different type of shoes. I am using Efficientnet (which are transfered training) to train my data available. There are 5 shoes category which are Ballet Flat, Boat, Brogue, Clog, and Sneaker.

## Steps to Generate Model

1. Data Loading
2. Exploratory Data  Analysis
3. Data  Augmentation
4. Model Training with Efficientnet with 4 optimizer to test
5. Model Improvement with added tuning
6. Model Inference
7. Conclusions

## Model conclusions

The model can predict well on sneakers shoes category and have a bias on it. Others shoes that appear to be made of skin are often mistakenly considered as a Boat shoes.
